# Autogen Framework for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Examples

Welcome to the repository showcasing examples of LLM-based multi-agent systems implemented using the Autogen framework.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating the use of the Autogen framework to build multi-agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Each example illustrates different scenarios where LLMs are utilized for various tasks within a multi-agent environment.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Autogen Framework
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Installation and Setup

To get started with any of the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/autogen-llm-multi-agent-examples.git cd autogen-llm-multi-agent-examples
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. Follow specific instructions in each example directory to set up and run the examples.

## Examples

Each example directory contains a README with detailed instructions on its purpose, setup, and execution:

- **Example 1:** Simple dialogue generation between LLM-based agents.
- **Example 2:** Collaborative storytelling using multiple LLMs.
- **Example 3:** Decision-making simulation in a virtual environment.

Explore each example to understand how LLMs can be leveraged for different types of multi-agent interactions.
